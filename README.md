# CAPTCHA-Recognition-From-Audio-Using-WhisperAI-And-OCR

This project focuses on transcribing CAPTCHA audio using Whisper AI and comparing its accuracy with ground truth text extracted from CAPTCHA images. The approach involves preprocessing the audio by normalizing its volume and applying loudness normalization to improve transcription quality. Whisper Medium, a version of OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model, is used for transcribing the pre-processed audio. Ground truth text is obtained using EasyOCR from corresponding CAPTCHA images. The transcription accuracy is evaluated by calculating the Character Error Rate (CER), which compares the Whisper AI output with OCR-extracted text. Despite GPU limitations, the project demonstrates the potential of Whisper AI for CAPTCHA transcription and highlights challenges such as misheard words and OCR inaccuracies. This method could be further improved with additional preprocessing and using more advanced Whisper models.
